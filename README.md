[Fooocus-API](https://github.com/mrhan1993/Fooocus-API) RunPod serverless worker implementation
___
The repository consists of two branches:
[NetworkVolume](https://github.com/davefojtik/RunPod-Fooocus-API/tree/NetworkVolume) and [Standalone](https://github.com/davefojtik/RunPod-Fooocus-API/tree/Standalone)

The **NetworkVolume** expects you to install and prepare your own instance on the RunPod network volume, or to use our `3wad/runpod-fooocus-api:0.4.1.0-networksetup` to do so. This is ideal if you want to change models, loras or other contents on the fly, let your users upload them, or persist generated image files right on the server. The downside of this solution is slower starts because everything has to be loaded over the data centre's network. See [network-guide](https://github.com/davefojtik/RunPod-Fooocus-API/blob/NetworkVolume/docs/network-guide.md) for step-by-step instructions.

The **Standalone** branch is a ready-to-use docker image with all the files and models already baked and installed into it. You can still customize it to use your own content, but it can't be changed without rebuilding and redeploying the image. This is ideal if you want the fastest, cheapest possible endpoint for long-term usage without the need for frequent changes in its contents. See [standalone-guide](https://github.com/davefojtik/RunPod-Fooocus-API/blob/Standalone/docs/standalone-guide.md) or simply use `3wad/runpod-fooocus-api:0.4.1.0-standalone` as the image for a quick deploy with the default Juggernaut V8 on your RunPod serverless endpoint.

All prebuilt images can be found here: https://hub.docker.com/r/3wad/runpod-fooocus-api

## How to send requests
[request_examples.js](https://github.com/davefojtik/RunPod-Fooocus-API/blob/NetworkVolume/docs/request_examples.js) contain example payloads for all endpoints on your serverless worker, regardless of the branch. But don't hesitate to ask if you need more help.

## Updates
We're not always on the latest version automatically, as there can be breaking changes or major bugs.
